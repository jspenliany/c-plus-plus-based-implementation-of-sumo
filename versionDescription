this version is a milestone.

The basic funtions of this version have been tested and worked well.

For the simulated scenario, several junctions located at the corner of the scenario.

when row=4 and col=3

the first row street intersects with the first column street at the first junction, the position of which is 0,0
the first row street intersects with the last  column street at the col+1th junction, the position of which is 0, maxy.

However, next version will make the junctions on the boundary of the scenario to be invisiable and NOT include in the valid
junctions that vehicular will traverse through.
