this version is make it clear that the wired linkage work well.

when set delay time, the dalay value is linear increase with the distance between two wired nodes.

bug exists

   when no additional nodes between nodes located at junctions, the layout is a little disorder.
   
  
  
  I have no idea with the rate that make the following formulation success
     
        rate * dist(jm,jn) = delay(jm,jn)
